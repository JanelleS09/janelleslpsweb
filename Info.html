<h2>History of Sipa</h2>
<p>Sipa has been played in the Philippines for hundreds of years, with roots tracing back to pre-colonial times. It was originally played barefoot using a rattan ball or a metal washer wrapped in cloth or rubber. The game became a national symbol of Filipino creativity and simplicity.</p>
<p>Historically, Sipa was played in open spaces such as plazas or schoolyards. In 2009, Arnis was officially recognized as the national sport of the Philippines, but Sipa remains a beloved traditional game and cultural icon. It's a favorite among children and is featured in local sports festivals and celebrations.There are two popular varieties of Sipa; the first uses a lead washer, while the second uses a woven rattan ball. People often mistake Sipa for a children’s game because children prefer the washer in Sipa.</p>
